# Project Progress Documentation

## Completed Work
- **R Interface Enhancements:**  
  - Added a `rule` parameter (default = 1) to the `Edge()` function.
  - Updated data structures in `Edge()`, `StartEnd()`, and `Node()` to include a "rule" column.
- **Graph Function Modifications:**  
  - Modified the `graph()` function to automatically generate null edges with `rule = 1`.
  - Ensured that auto-generated null edges are combined with original edges while preserving original rule values.
- **Testing:**  
  - Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/testthat/test-edge-rule.R` to verify:
    - Default and custom rule values.
    - Vectorization of the rule parameter.
    - Correct merging of edges with different rule values.
  - Developed additional tests in `tests/testthat/test-graph.R` to ensure proper state ordering and integration of null edges.
- **Methodology:**  
  - Incremental development with continuous testing via `devtools::test()`.
  - Preservation of backward compatibility while augmenting internal data handling for time-dependent constraints.
