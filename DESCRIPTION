Description: Penalized parametric changepoint detection by functional pruning dynamic programming algorithm. 
  The successive means are constrained using a graph structure with edges of type null, up, down, std or abs. To each edge we can associate some additional properties: a minimal gap size, a penalty, some robust parameters (K,a). The user can also constrain the inferred means to lie between some minimal and maximal values. Data is modelized by a quadratic cost with possible use of a robust loss, biweight and Huber (see edge parameters K and a). Other losses are also available with log-linear representation (variance, poisson, exp) or a log-log representation (negbin).
